#### :one: - Get an API Key
The first thing you will need to do register with Dark Sky and get a your own private API key.
* You can register here: https://darksky.net/dev/register
* Once you have registered, you should be able to see your API key here: https://darksky.net/dev/account

 **Important: Keep this key private!**
 
#### :two: - Put your API key in a Property List  
In the Feels Like directory, you will need to make a property list file with your API key.
* Open `Feels Like.xcworkspace` in Xcode
* `File` --> `New` --> `File...`
* Select `Property List`
* Press `Next`
* Name the file `keys`
* Make sure the file is created in the `Feels Like` directory
* Press `Create`
* Open `keys.plist` in Xcode
* Press the :heavy_plus_sign: button to add a new item
  * Key: `darkSkyKey`
  * Type: `String`
  * Value: `YOUR_API_KEY`
  
#### :three: - Build and run! 
If you run into issues, let me know.
